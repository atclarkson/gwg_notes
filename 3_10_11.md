# 3.10.11 Defaults and Destructuring
------------------------------------
## Defaults and destructuring arrays
You can combine default function parameters with **destructuring** to create some pretty powerful functions!

```javascript
function createGrid([width = 5, height = 5]) {
  return `Generates a ${width} x ${height} grid`;
}

createGrid([]); // Generates a 5 x 5 grid
createGrid([2]); // Generates a 2 x 5 grid
createGrid([2, 3]); // Generates a 2 x 3 grid
createGrid([undefined, 3]); // Generates a 5 x 3 grid
```
>__Returns:__
Generates a 5 x 5 grid
Generates a 2 x 5 grid
Generates a 2 x 3 grid
Generates a 5 x 3 grid

Do this basically uses destructuring to generate a grid.

__Problem__
if you don't pass an empty array to the function you get an error
```javascript
createGrid(); // throws an error
```
>__Uncaught TypeError:__ Cannot read property 'Symbol(Symbol.iterator)' of undefined

This throws an error because the function was expecting an array but didn't get it.  
We can fix this by using a default function parameter
```javascript
function createGrid([width  = 5, height = 5] = []) {
  return `Generates a ${width} c ${height} grid`;
}
```
__Notice__ the ` = []` this makes sure that if nothing is passed to the function `createGrid()` then it will default to an empty array.
```javascript
createGrid(); // Generates a 5 x 5 grid
```
>__Returns:__ Generates a 5 x 5 grid
>

## Defaults and destructuring objects
Just like with arrays you can also have an objects as a default parameter and use object destructuring.
```javascript
function createSundae({scoops = 1, toppings = ['Hot Fudge']}) {
  const scoopText = scoops === 1 ? 'scoops' : 'scoops'; // plural or not?
  return `Your sundae has ${scoops} ${scoopText} with ${toppings.join(' and ')} toppings.`;
}

createSundae({}); // Your sundae has 1 scoop with Hot Fudge toppings.
createSundae({scoops: 2}); // Your sundae has 2 scoops with Hot Fudge toppings.
createSundae({scoops: 2, toppings: ['Sprinkles']}); // Your sundae has 2 scoops with Sprinkles toppings.
createSundae({toppings: ['Cookie Dough']}); // Your sundae has 1 scoop with Cookie Dough toppings.
```

> __Returns:__
> <br>Your sundae has 1 scoop with Hot Fudge toppings.
> <br>Your sundae has 2 scoops with Hot Fudge toppings.
> <br>Your sundae has 2 scoops with Sprinkles toppings.
> <br>Your sundae has 1 scoop with Cookie Dough toppings.

So that works but without any arguments you get an error:

```javascript
createSundae(); // throws an error
```
>__Uncaught TypeError:__ Cannot match against 'undefined' or 'null'.

So again just like in an array you can just make the default case an empty object `= {}`.
```javascript
function createSundae({scoops = 1, toppings = ['Hot Fudge']} = {}) {
  const scoopText = scoops === 1 ? 'scoop' : 'scoops';
  return `Your sundae has ${scoops} ${scoopText} with ${toppings.join(' and ')} toppings.`;
}
```
```javascript
createSundae(); // Your sundae has 1 scoop with Hot Fudge toppings.
```
>__Returns:__ Your sundae has 1 scoop of Hot Fudge toppings.

## Array defaults vs. object defaults

It is recommended to use object destructuring over array destructuring.

If you want to skip an option in an object you can just skip it, in an array you have to plug in 'undefined' as that element as arrays are position based while objects are based on key/value pairs.

Consider the following examples:
```javascript
function createSundae({scoops = 1, toppings = ['Hot Fudge']} = {}) { … }
```
If you don't want to feed in the number scoops and you just want use the default scoops you can just skip that element:
```javascript
createSundae({toppings: ['Hot Fudge', 'Sprinkles', 'Caramel']});
```
Whereas with an array
```javascript
function createSundae([scoops = 1, toppings = ['Hot Fudge']] = []) { … }
```
You would need to plug in `undefined` to make it skip scoops and use the default:
```javascript
createSundae([undefined, ['Hot Fudge', 'Sprinkles', 'Caramel']]);
```
